## Explainability

---

- *<u>feature importance</u> shows what variables most affect predictions*
- *<u>partial dependence</u> plots show how a feature affects predictions*
  - *If you are familiar with linear or logistic regression models, partial dependence plots can be interpreted similarly to the coefficients in those models.*
